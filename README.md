# blochSim
Matlab and C++ Libraries for Bloch Equation Simulations in MRI. I made this code after following along with the tutorial given by Brian Hargreaves at http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/bloch/. If you have any questions about how it works, that is a great resource. Dr. Hargreaves also has an MRI Tools library at http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/mritools.html.

Also, these functions have been working in my projects, but are still very much a work in progress. Please feel free to report bugs or submit additional methods.
